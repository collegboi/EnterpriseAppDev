Everything in /test/aws was pulled from the test suite download here: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-v4-test-suite.html

I've removed 12 cases that I have no plans in supporting. I think all of them related to dupe headers and querystring sorting.

===

Example of dupe header test case that I removed:

ZOO:foo
zoo:bar
zoo:foobar

Gets turned into this in the canonical string:

zoo:bar,foo,foobar

===

Since this isn't supported in most clients REST clients anyway, I see no reason in worrying about it here.
